Process a sitemap.xml for consumption by Ada's AI Agent.

To use:

1. Add your knowledge API key
2. Add your Ada instance subdomain
3. List knowledge sources and make sure the source you want to create doesn't already exist.
4. Provide a link to a sitemap.xml you want to crawl
5. Name the knowledge source you want to create
6. Run the scraping job!

Sit back, Scrada will open Chrome on your mac and iterate through the web pages it finds in the sitemap. This will get around most bot protections. 
Once it has scraped all the web pages, they will be uploaded into the Knowledge Hub through the API.
